# Use a password to scramble the alphabet into some order 
# 1. remove any duplicate letters from the psw
# 2. split the alphabet into two halves. The letters up to and including the last letter in the password and the rest of the alphabet
# 3. remove any letters in your psw from the two halves of the alphabet
# 4. the key is the concatenation of the psw( without duplicate letters) follwoed by the second part of the split alphabet followed by 
#    the first part of the alphabet.
